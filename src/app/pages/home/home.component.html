    <p class="lead">I'm passionate about coding in <span class="text-muted fw-bold font-monospace">C#</span>; it’s what
        I do for a living, but it’s also what I enjoy every day as I solve new challenges.</p>
    <p class="lead">
        A lot has changed since I first started coding in Pascal back in 2004 in Tandil, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Now,
        I'm based in Azul, a town not far from there and the place where I was born.

        <span class="font-monospace">[Code in Blue]</span> is a nod to my beginnings with Turbo Pascal, where I often
        coded against a blue screen, and it’s also a reference to the name of my hometown.
